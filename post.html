        <h3>42 Abu Dhabi</h3>

        <p>This was a school where I first got into coding deeply with C language. I was a June Pisciner, studied there for a month and got accepted at 1-year program, the Cursus.
            <br>
            <br> The school is newly opened and welcoming students from all around the world. It is a school that is dedicated to the development of young people who are interested in coding.
            <br>
            <br> The school is located in the heart of Abu Dhabi and is a part of the 42 Network. It uses peer-to-peer learning, which means that students can learn from each other.
            <br>
            <br> Students get ready for real-life projects by reviewing each other's code and discussing their ideas. The school is a place where students can learn to code and become a part of the community.
            <br>
            <br> I enjoyed studying here, making a lof of international friends. This was one of the incredible experiences I ever had.</p>
